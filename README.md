## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a [code of conduct](https://github.com/si2-urssi/winterschool-Dec2025/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the URSSI Winter School and all associated spaces, both physical and digital. Please review this.

Also, the URSSI Winter School is a scent-free environment. We would like to ask the participants to refrain from using any scented lotions, perfumes, essential oils, scented antiperspirants, etc., as these make the space inaccessible for folks with asthma, allergies to the scents, or with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. Having a scent-free environment will help prevent dizziness, nausea, breathing difficulties, headaches, and other issues among our participants.

## Instructors

[Kyle Niemeyer](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io) is an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering.
He leads a research group that uses computation to investigate problems involving reacting-fluid flows (particularly combustion and fire) and particle transport, and with a focus on
how to efficiently use modern high-performance computing systems. He's also an Associate Editor-in-Chief of the [_Journal of Open Source Software_ (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org).

[Madicken Munk](https://github.com/munkm) is an Assistant Professor in the School of Nuclear Science and Engineering at Oregon State University. Previously, she was a postdoc at the University of Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing Applications where she was a maintainer and release manager of yt, a visualization package for simulation data.

[Joanna Piper Morgan](https://jpmorgan98.github.io) is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Nuclear Criticality Safety Division at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. She received her PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University, working on techniques for modeling time-dependent neutron transport using Monte Carlo methods, and specifically strategies for doing this on high-performance/heterogeneous computing systems enabled by Python.

## Requirements

You will need a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that you have administrative privileges on, and need some specific software packages installed:

- the Bash shell; you should only have to set this up if you are using a Windows machine, following the [Software Carpentry setup instructions](http://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup)
- Git
- Python 3.x; we recommend installing [miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/) for simplicity and install packages to environments as needed 
- a text editor, preferably one designed for writing code; we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)

You should also sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one.

Specific Python packages (install with `pip` or `conda`):
- `pytest`
- `sphinx`

## Projects

You will have open work time to spend on an individual project where you develop a Python-based research software package.
Please bring an idea or some basis for a project.

Ideally, this should be something that supports your work and that you would (or could) continue developing or using after the winter school.
We hope that most—or at least some—of the projects will eventually be submitted to the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org), which we'll briefly talk about on the final day.

## Reimbursements

Please follow the instructions you will receive over email and reach out to Kyle Niemeyer with a ny questions or concerns.
