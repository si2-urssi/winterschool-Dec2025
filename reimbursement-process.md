# Reimbursement Process

Thanks to the Sloan Foundation grant that supports the URSSI Schools on Research Software Engineering, we can reimburse you for your travel expenses 
(excluding the hotel stay and possibly your flight, which should have been directly billed to Oregon State).

1. Everyone should soon receive an invitation to register as a vendor through OSU's BennyBuy system. You should register as an individual, 
add your SSN, and then upload a filled W-9 form (though you will not actually be taxed for the reimbursement). 
If you are asked for a job title / role, you can say "workshop participant". Please make sure you complete this ASAP!
2. Separately from the BennyBuy system, download and add your personal information and travel expenses to the ["NonOSU_TravelReimbursement-Dec17return.pdf"](./NonOSU_TravelReimbursement-Dec17return.pdf)
or ["NonOSU_TravelReimbursement-Dec18return.pdf"](./NonOSU_TravelReimbursement-Dec18return.pdf) form, which has been pre-populated with some information depending on the day you arrive home. 
For the handful of you that are staying in the area and flying back later, please use the Dec 17 return form, as your additional travel days are personal.
  - Add your personal info (leave "OSU ID#" blank)
  - In Travel Itinerary section, add your home city. Modify the dates you left and returned home if different.
  - The Meals section is already filled out for you, accounting for provided meals (breakfast @ hotel, lunch on Monday and Tuesday, and dinner on Tuesday).
  - Skip the "Claiming Meals at Actual Cost" section.
  - On the next page, if you drove to Portland, add the dates and mileage to the "Personal Vehicle Mileage" section.
  - In the "Other Travel Expenses" section, add your airfare (only if you paid for flights yourself) or ground transportation costs (such as train, bus, public transit). Note that we will not reimburse for Lyft/Uber/taxi from the airports to the hotel, unless the MAX was not available.
  - If you run out of space in "Ground Transportation", you can use the "Other" lines.
  - Use "Parking" if you parked at your home airport (we only allow economy parking).
3. You'll need to attach receipts for all expenses above $25. Do not include receipts for meals, since we are using the fixed per diem rates for Portland.
4. Please email a single PDF to Bingxin Lin <bingxin.lin@oregonstate.edu> with the subject line "Reimbursement request for URSSI Winter School". You can also email Bingxin with any questions about the reimbursement form.
