# Travel info for Portland winter school

## Getting to the hotel from the airport

The [Courtyard by Marriott Portland City Center](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/pdxpc-courtyard-portland-city-center/overview/) 
is located at 550 SW Oak Street, Portland, OR, USA, 97204.

For those flying into PDX, please plan on taking the [TriMet](http://www.trimet.org/) to the hotel; 
we will not reimburse taxis or rideshare service costs without prior approval for specific needs.
The MAX Light Rail Red Line picks up at the airport and has stops nearby the hotel, at 
Oak St/Sw 1st Ave and Pioneer Square North, which are four-five short blocks away from the hotel.
The fare for this trip is $2.80 each way, and it takes about 30 minutes.

For those driving to Portland from nearby, you may park your car at the hotel and the cost will be covered.

## Getting to the event from the hotel

The Winter School will be held at the [OSU Portland Center](https://portland.oregonstate.edu/), in room 2029.
This is located inside the Meier & Frank Building at 555 SW Morrison Street.
The OSU Portland Center is about four blocks away from the hotel down SW 6th Ave, about 0.2 miles and a 5-6 minute walk.

The building is access controlled, so please show the [guest pass](https://github.com/si2-urssi/winterschool-Dec2025/blob/main/OSU-guest-pass.png)
to the security guard at the front entrance.

Bring an umbrella or rainjacket, though, as it is rainy season in the Pacific Northwest!

## Special needs

If you have special accessibility needs that would make getting to the hotel or to/from the meeting challenging, please let Kyle Niemeyer know ASAP.
